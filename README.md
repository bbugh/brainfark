# Brainfark

An Elixir interpreter for
[Brainferk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

There are many interpretations of Brainfunk, this one is based on the [Codewars
interpeter exercise](https://www.codewars.com/kata/my-smallest-code-interpreter-aka-brainf-star-star-k/train/ruby).

Look, I'm not one to avoid swearing, but you know how sometimes when you're
coding, words start to sound weird and lose all meaning? I don't want to lose
that word. It's so *colorful*. Hence, Brainflok.

## Installation

Don't install it yet, it's incomplete.

## Usage

mix deps.get
mix escript.build
./brainfark
```

BEHOLD! I have created this thing!
